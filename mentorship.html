                For one academic year, our Mentorship Program connects marginalized gender students (mentees) one-on-one with industry
                professionals (mentors). Our mentees are given the opportunity to continue their professional development alongside
                their mentor through monthly calls, where mentors can answer questions and offer advice. Additionally, mentees are
                encouraged to network among each other and can attend professional development workshops.

            <h2>Mentee</h2>
            <div class="row" style="margin-bottom: 20px; text-align: left;">
                <p>
                    Did you know for every 5-person esports team, there’s a 50-person team behind them? The esports and game development
                    industry is vast, with jobs ranging from marketing to game design. As a result, there’s plenty of opportunities and
                    spaces for anyone interested in gaming to join!
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    As students of marginalized gender groups, we understand the difficulty in connecting to professional resources
                    about
                    game development. Our mentorship program helps students learn from and connect with industry professionals, as well
                    as
                    feel more comfortable overall when entering the game industry themselves someday.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mentees must be university/college students, part of a marginalized gender group, and willing to commit one academic
                    year (September to May) to be eligible for our mentorship program. We generally open sign-ups around August, so be on
                    the lookout for our application!
                </p>

                <p>In the past, we’ve had mentors from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Riot Games</li>
                        <li>Bungie</li>

                    Interested in mentoring a student? Become a mentor for CMGG! Our mentorship program allows mentors to connect with
                    and
                    share their professional experiences with a college student from a marginalized gender group for one academic year.
                    Most
                    importantly, our mentors not only guide the next generation of gaming professionals, but also make sure the industry
                    can
                    become more diverse and inclusive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mentor sign-ups open around August, and our program runs from September to May. Mentors must currently work (or have
                    recent experience working) in the game industry. While we accept mentors from all backgrounds, we encourage those
                    from
                    marginalized gender groups to apply to better reflect our mentees’ identities.
                </p>

                <p>We aren't recruiting currently, link will be available in August!</p>
