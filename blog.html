                        Hi, I'm Sara! I'm a 4th year philosophy student and this is my second year being apart of CMGG 💗💗 If you've seen
                        me around, you probably know that I love expressing myself with fun, bright colors and accessories! The first game I
                        really got into (besides minecraft) was overwatch back in early 2017, and you can still find me playing it nearly every
                        day. I'm a support/tank player so if you ever want to queue together let me know :3 I also really enjoy genshin impact,
                        tetris, and a lot of other indie games with pretty art and music 🪷🌟 Besides gaming, I really love music - both
                        listening and playing piano/guitar, arts and crafts, and learning about topics in applied ethics. You can find me on the
                        CMGG discord server a lot (orchin#1863) so please say hi if you wanna talk or are interested in any of these topics too!
                        :D 💫🌸🦦

                        Hello!!! I'm Annika Liu, a freshman studying CS and Media Studies and also an intended game designer! I'm a big fan
                        for Blizzard games and my favorites are Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm, and World of Warcraft. In my free time I also do
                        digital art and watch anime. The most recent anime I watched is Neon Genesis Evangelion. I loved the story plot and
                        character designs. My battle.net id is k1ss#11639. If you ever wanna play Blizzard games or any other games, message me
                        and I'm happy to try almost any games:D

                        Hi y'all! I'm a Marketing Writer at Riot Games, but before that I was a CMGG Board member for 3 years +
                        graduated
                        from Cal as part of the class of 2021. CMGG was definitely the most important part of my college experience
                        and I'm glad
                        to still be involved as a mentor! I work on all kinds of projects at Riot, mostly on Wild Rift and League of
                        Legends PC.
                        My favorite thing I've worked on lately that's out in the world is the Nilah Champion Spotlight, which you
                        can watch
                        here:

                        I love to play ranked League of Legends and recently I've been super into Fortnite. I'm also finishing up
                        Kirby and the
                        Forgotten Land on my Switch. Outside of games, I love to take film photos, thrift clothing, and I've started
                        learning
                        how to draw digitally. I also like making all my friends watch the Bachelor with me.
